## BatchCode

BatchCode is a batch processing utility designed to handle structured code or data transformations in a clean and modular way.

This project was built using an AI-assisted workflow, where AI was used as a coding accelerator while architectural decisions, refactoring, and cleanup were done manually. The main goal of this project is to explore how AI can be used responsibly in real-world development without sacrificing code clarity and maintainability.

### Key Features
- Modular and readable project structure
- Clear separation of responsibilities
- Designed for extensibility and future refactoring
- Lightweight and dependency-minimal

### Why This Project
BatchCode is a personal learning project focused on:
- Understanding real-world project structure
- Practicing refactoring and cleanup of AI-generated code
- Improving engineering judgment beyond just writing code

### Status
This project is actively evolving and may undergo structural refactors as the design matures.
